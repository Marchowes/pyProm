### pyProm v0.0


This library is still under development. Do not expect full functionality, or documentation until release 1.0

pyProm
======

The purpose of PyProm is to load Surface datasets for discovery of Summit, Saddles (cols),
Prominence, and data manipulation/parsing of those datapoints. The goal is the take in a number of
different data formats, as well as produce a number of different result formats, including common
ones like KML.

pyProm is written in Python, which is a fairly accessible language to most people. My hope is once 
a stable, and well documented version can be produced, others can add features as they see fit.

This library is inspired by [WinProm](https://github.com/edwardearl/winprom), by the late [Edward Earl](http://peakbagger.com/climber/climber.aspx?cid=601), as well as the number of websites
which make use of similiarly derived data, such as [LoJ](listsofjohn.com) and [peakbagger](peakbagger.com)
